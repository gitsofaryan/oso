/**
 * Enhanced context types with branded types for compile-time tracking of middleware application.
 *
 * These types use TypeScript's branded types pattern to ensure that resolver handlers
 * can only access certain context properties (like `client`, `userId`, `orgRole`) if the
 * appropriate middleware has been applied through the resolver builder.
 *
 * There are exactly 4 context types, one per access-control tier:
 *
 * | Directory       | Middleware                    | Context Type                 |
 * |-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
 * | organization/   | withOrgScopedClient(getOrgId) | OrgScopedContext             |
 * | user/           | withAuthenticatedClient()     | AuthenticatedClientContext   |
 * | resource/       | withOrgResourceClient(...)    | ResourceScopedContext        |
 * | system/         | withSystemClient()            | SystemContext                |
